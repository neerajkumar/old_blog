## Profile
---
I love to code, I like to help people through code and I like to work with developers. I have some experience under my belt and I really like web and mobile app development. I am super interested in design, performance, data-modeling and shipping products fast.

I have spoken at conferences, written a few blogs and created a popular screencast. I have developed mobile apps, web applications, few GIS applications and programmed for companies like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey&Company among other clients in the US, UK, Europe and Japan.
