## Profile
---
I love to code, I love to write Ruby codes, I love programming and I love to solve programming challenges. I like to help people with the help of my past experiences. I also like to learn by other's way of thinking and coding. I believe I have enough and pertinent energy, gravitas and strength to learn and adopt which enables me to play a good team member role as well as sovereign contributor. 

I have contributed in open source and will always love to contribute because I believe that it hones my skills by the exposure and interaction of other's style of coding. I have presented in [RubyConfIndia2010](http://rubyconfindia.org/2010/) on [The Ruby On Rails I18n Core Api](http://www.slideshare.net/neerajkumar09/the-ruby-on-rails-i18n-core-api). I have developed many web applications using ruby on rails, angular.js, ampersand.js etc. I am always open for innovations, new ideas and new technologies and I am extensively interested in design, performance, efficacious coding practices and, specially, Big Data.
